#PROFILE AND MULTIPLE INSTANCES ##ERROR PRONE

- question: Can i have multiple users with different permissions on a single intaQt installation?
  answer: |
    A single intaQt installation can be used by multiple users if each profile, for which a 
    valid license has been installed, overwrites the necessary 
    configurations from the Server.conf. (see: Additional Configurations below).

      - technical
  source: https://docs.qitasc.com/installation/installerinstances/

- question: With multiple profiles, we are still having a seperate instance for each user, right?
  answer: |
    Yes, you are indeed running separate instances of intaQt for each user. 
    Each user has their own instance of intaQt, and they can use the same intaQt installation
    as long as they have a valid license. However, it's important to note that while they share
    the installation, each user's instance should have its own unique configurations based on
    their profile to ensure proper isolation and customization for their specific needs.

- question: What are the steps for creating a new profile?
  answer: |
    Creating a new profile in intaQt involves several steps, including setting up a 
    separate configuration folder for the profile and specifying its details. 
    Here are the steps to create a new profile:

    1. Navigate to the intaQt Installation Directory:
      - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where intaQt is installed. 
      This is typically the directory where intaQt's binaries and configuration files are located.

    2. Create a Configuration Subfolder for the New Profile:
      - Inside the `config` folder of your intaQt installation directory, create a new subfolder
       with the name of your desired profile. This subfolder will hold the configuration files specific to this profile.

      Example:
      ```
      config/
      âââ default/
      âââ customProfile/  <-- Create this folder for the new profile
      ```

    3. Create or Customize Profile-Specific Configuration Files:
      - Inside the new profile's subfolder (`customProfile` in the example above), you can create or customize configuration files specific to this profile. These configuration files should contain settings and parameters relevant to the new profile.

      Example:
      ```
      config/
      âââ default/
      âââ customProfile/
      â   âââ Profile.conf
      â   âââ AnotherConfig.conf
      ```

    4. Specify Profile Details in Configuration Files:
      - In the profile-specific configuration files, specify the details and settings unique to this profile. These settings will overwrite any corresponding settings in the default configuration when this profile is used.

    5. Start intaQt with the New Profile:
      - When starting intaQt, you can specify the profile to use with the `-p` option followed by the profile name.

      Example:
      ```bash
      intaqt -p customProfile
      ```

      This command starts intaQt using the configuration settings from the `customProfile` subfolder.

- question: Can i view the currently configured profiles for an intaQt installation?
  answer: |
    To view the currently installed profiles, use the following:
    license-installer -s <product Product|
    Parameter:
    product - The product installed. May be one of intaqt or intaqt-verification
    Example:
    license-installer -s intaqt

  source: https://docs.qitasc.com/installation/installerinstances/

- question: Where do i find profile specific logs and data?
  answer: |
    When starting multiple intaQt Service instances on the same physical machine with the use of profiles, 
    each instance has its own Reporting Service database and Scheduler database. 
    On startup, the profile is used to specify the database URL. 

    If the profile is the default profile, its databases are stored in:
    intaqt/data/reporting/hsql (Reporting)
    intaqt/data/quartz/hsql (Scheduler)

    If the profile is any other named profile, its databases are stored in:
    intaqt/data/<profileName|/reporting/hsql (Reporting)
    intaqt/data/<profileName|/quartz/hsql (Scheduler)

    If these directories do not exist upon intaQt's startup, they will be created and an empty database will be initialized. If the directory already exists, the existing database will be used.
