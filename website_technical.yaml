  # AUDIO

- question: How do i test audio if my phone lacks an audio port?
  answer: |
    We developed a phone hub to offer audio support for recording and reading out audio signals. 
    Because newer Android phones lack an audio port we developed a Bluetooth adapter containing three Bluetooth antennas.

- question: How do I test audio-driven systems with intaQt?
  answer: |
    With intaQt audio plugin that is currently used for monitoring speech channel quality as well as recording and comparing
    audio files (Audio Fingerprinting) within intaQt test cases.

- question: How speech channel monitoring works?
  answer: |
    Playing the reference audio file: The reference audio file is a fixed audio file that is located on the Raspberry Pi's
    Audio Service. It consists of beeps with a duration of 300 milliseconds and a frequency of 800 Hz or 1100 Hz. The pauses
    between the beeps last 300 milliseconds.
    Recording the playback: The recording is done on the phone that is not playing the reference audio file. The recording
    is done once and in parallel for both directions (A to B and B to A).
    Analyzing the recording: The recording is analyzed to detect the locations and durations of beeps and pauses. This is done
    using three criteria:
    The total number of beeps must meet or exceed the minimum threshold of expected beeps.
    The recording's predominant frequency must match the beeps' nominal frequency (800 Hz or 1100 Hz).
    The pause position and duration must be correct.

- question: How audio fingerprinting works?
  answer: |
    A given audio recording is compared to a set of reference recordings by using the intaQt Audio Matcher. 
    The Audio Matcher reads the audio recording and uses an algorithm to compute a collection of Audio Fingerprints. 
    This collection of fingerprints is characteristic of the recording. 
    The fingerprints of the recording to be assessed is then compared to a collection of fingerprints that is calculated from reference recordings. 
    Every comparison yields a similarity score between 0 and 100. A higher number indicates a stronger similarity to the reference recording.

- question: How a match is achieved with Audio Fingerprinting?
  answer: |
    intaQt matches a recording against a set of recordings announcements by:
    Calculating the recording's fingerprints.
    Comparing the recording's fingerprints with all reference announcements' fingerprints. Every comparison yields a similarity score.
    The best match is the match with the highest number of equal fingerprints.,

- question: What do i need to use the Audio Plugin of intaQt?
  answer: |
    A Raspberry Pi for each phone that is used for audio recording.
    The Raspberry Pi running a service called Audio Service.
    Each Raspberry Pi is connected through a USB sound card to a given phone using a special audio cable.
    A phone's unique mapping to the Raspberry Pi configured via intaQt to link the phone's serial number to the Raspberry's IP address.
