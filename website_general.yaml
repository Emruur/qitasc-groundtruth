    Yes, you hand over testing and retesting activities to us. This involves contracting our in-house test engineers to execute tests for you.

- question: I can not decide if i need managed testing or not.
  answer: |
    Managed testing is an ideal choice when the testing topic is complex and involves coordinating multiple parties, 
    which requires resources and expertise about interdependent technical requirements. However, you might avoid it if project is very small, 
    and all resources are available
    Project/technology know-how is very specific
    Intellectual property rights must be kept secure
    The used test data must stay secure, such as customer data
    Short running, one-off projects
